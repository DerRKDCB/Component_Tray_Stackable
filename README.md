# Stackable Component Tray

A storage system for small parts, desined for 3D Printing and minimal material usage.
Customisable size and grid in a FreeCAD Project.

Trays can be locked together with M2/2mm Cotter Pins [aliexpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/32972332173.html?spm=a2g0o.detail.1000060.2.161d6d90Fhh161&gps-id=pcDetailBottomMoreThisSeller&scm=1007.13339.169870.0&scm_id=1007.13339.169870.0&scm-url=1007.13339.169870.0&pvid=d631fafd-9563-479e-ad5f-fe660dfc227c&_t=gps-id:pcDetailBottomMoreThisSeller,scm-url:1007.13339.169870.0,pvid:d631fafd-9563-479e-ad5f-fe660dfc227c,tpp_buckets:668%230%23131923%2341_668%230%23131923%2341_668%23888%233325%2312_668%23888%233325%2312_668%232846%238112%231997_668%232717%237565%23716_668%231000022185%231000066059%230_668%233468%2315614%23530_668%232846%238112%231997_668%232717%237565%23716_668%233164%239976%23407_668%233468%2315614%23530)

## Variants

Default size is 160mm * 160mm * 15mm. Patterns in this size (up to 8x8 grid) can be found in the STL folder.
As the Tray is always square and symmetrical, for example 6x5 is the same as 5x6.

To change the size or grid pattern, you can just change the parameters in the Spreadsheet of the FreeCAD project, after that your custom tray will be generated.

With the Tray also comes an insert, which can be used to swap components fast.

## Printing

Recommendet settings:
- 0.4mm nozzle
- 0.2mm layer hight
- PLA

The tray is designed to use minimal filament and time, so the walls of the grid is only one parimeter. If you want to use a different nozzle you may have to adjust the parameters in FreeCAD.
